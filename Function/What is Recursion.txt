Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. 
In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

===> Recursion is a process where a fuction can call itself.
===> We need to stop this fuction call other with it will become infinite function.
===> To stop calling we need to use base case.


Two Important points for Recursion Function.

1. Recursive Call
2. Base Case




Recursion Example:
5! = 5*4*3*2*1
4! = 4*3*2*1
3! = 3*2*1
2! = 2*1
1! = 1
Formula:
n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)!
